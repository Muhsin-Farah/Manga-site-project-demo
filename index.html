            <h1>Kingdom</h1>
             <div class="small-container">
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-3"> <img src="/website cheater one/images/kingdom2.jpg"></div>
                <div class="col-3"> <img src="/website cheater one/images/Kingdom 3.jpg"></div>

               </div>
            <p>Kingdom makes it top of the list for me as it was something once i started reading it couldn't stop, even though it has cliche tropes of an underdog striving to be the best, it really
              excels in its large scale battles and plot twists giving a dramatic and interesting read to the historical events that lead to the unification of china into one country after many centuries of conflcict war.
            Certain arcs such as the coalition arc was by far the best story arc of anything i've ever seen aside from maybe attack on titan which didn't make the list because i didn't like the ending. </p>

            <h1>Jojos</h1>

               </div>
            <p>Jojos bizzare adventure really deserves its name as being bizzare it is the most unique and strange pick on my list as it has the most variety of any series from vampires to mystery killers in a town with
              an alien, Jojos has the best fights as each one isn't a straight up brawl it always involves outsmarting your opponent and making the best of your environment and own abilities to outsmart
              and defeat enemies .</p>
            <h2>Vagabond</h2>
            <div class="small-container">
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-3"> <img src="/website cheater one/images/vagabond.jfif"></div>
                <div class="col-3"> <img src="/website cheater one/images/vagabond 3.jpg"></div>
                <div class="col-3"> <img src="/website cheater one/images/vagabond 4.jpg"></div>
      
               </div>
            <p>Vagabond is a manga about the legendary samurai mushashi miyamoto i enjoy it greatly because it represents a new cultural background in the Japan with feuding lords and samurai, it shows the struggle
              of a yound samurai striving to be the greatest and has many deep life lessons and beatiful artwork and visuals alongside the action scenes</p>
            <h2>One piece</h2>
            <div class="small-container">
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-3"> <img src="/website cheater one/images/one piece 2.jpg"></div>

                <div class="col-3"> <img src="/website cheater one/images/one piece 3.jpg"></div>
      
               </div>
            <p>One piece is a long running series about pirates but it's much more than that with lots of mysteries and world building of dmany many islands each with their own culture unique design and 
              history. This series has the best world building and foreshadowing of any manga with over 25 years of plot progression never getting stale or boring it is now the most selling manga of all time and outsells many
              famous comics like batman.
